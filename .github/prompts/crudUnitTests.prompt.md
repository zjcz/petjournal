## Generating Unit Tests for CRUD Operations

Write the unit tests for all the CRUD calls for the `[db object name]` database object in #database_service.dart . Follow the standard used in the #database_service_pet_test.dart unit test file
and ensure that the tests are comprehensive and cover all possible scenarios. The tests should include:

- Create: Test the creation of a new record and verify that it is stored correctly in the database.
- Read: Test the retrieval of an existing record and verify that the correct data is returned.
- Update: Test the update of an existing record and verify that the changes are reflected in the database.
- Delete: Test the deletion of an existing record and verify that it is removed from the database.
- Error handling: Test the error handling for each CRUD operation, including invalid data and database errors.
- Edge cases: Test edge cases for each CRUD operation, such as creating a record with missing required fields or retrieving a non-existent record.
- Performance: Test the performance of each CRUD operation, including the time taken to create, read, update, and delete a record.
- Security: Test the security of each CRUD operation, including access control and data validation.
- Documentation: Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows best practices for unit testing in Dart.
- Code quality: Ensure that the code follows best practices for Dart programming, including naming conventions, code organization, and error handling.
- Test coverage: Ensure that the tests cover all possible scenarios and edge cases, and that the code is thoroughly tested.
- Test data: Use realistic test data for all CRUD operations, including valid and invalid data.
