Write the CRUD methods to access the `[db object name]` table from #pet_weight.dart
and ensure that the methods are well-documented and follow best practices for database access in Dart. The methods should include:

- Create: A method to create a new record in the database.
- Read: A method to retrieve an existing record from the database.
- Read all: A method to retrieve all records from the database for a pet Id.
- Update: A method to update an existing record in the database.
- Delete: A method to delete an existing record from the database.
- Error handling: Ensure that the methods handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.
- Edge cases: Ensure that the methods handle edge cases, such as creating a record with missing required fields or retrieving a non-existent record.
- Performance: Ensure that the methods are optimized for performance and do not cause unnecessary database queries.
- Security: Ensure that the methods are secure and do not expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to the database.
- Documentation: Ensure that the methods are well-documented and follow best practices for database access in Dart.
- Code quality: Ensure that the methods follow best practices for Dart programming, including naming conventions, code organization, and error handling.
