### Tests

Rules:

- Write unit tests for any code you generate.
- Write integration tests for any code you generate.
- If mocks are required, use the mockito library.
- Tests should be generated in the /test directory.
- Use the test directory structure to mirror the lib directory structure.
- When writing tests to get, list or delete a record, write additional tests to check that the records not found are handled correctly.
- When writing tests to check that a record is created, updated or deleted, test all the fields of a record that have been updated or set in the test contain the expected values.
- Use "[method name] should [expected behaviour] when [condition]" for the test description.
- Use the test name to describe the test case. For example, "GetUserById Should return User When user exists" instead of "testGetUserById".
- Use the AAA pattern for test cases. Arrange, Act, Assert. Use comments to separate the sections of the test.
