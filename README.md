## ü™Ñ AI Coding Assistant

Github Copilot AI assistant was used initially when working on this project.

The project includes a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file that contains instructions for the AI coding assistant. The instructions are designed to ensure that the code generated by the assistant follows the project's coding standards and best practices. The instructions cover general rules, UI design, and testing guidelines.

[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) MCP server was used to provide the AI coding assistant with access to documentation for libraries like Flutter, Riverpod, Drift, and Mockito. The Context7 server is set up to provide the assistant with the latest documentation and examples for these libraries, ensuring that the code generated is up-to-date and follows best practices.

Finally, `.github/flutter_dart_riverpod_mockito.md` was included from [flutter-ai-rules](https://github.com/evanca/flutter-ai-rules) repository to provide additional context and rules for the AI coding assistant.

Later, [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) and [Gemini Code Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist) were used instead as the CLI seemed to generate better Flutter and Dart code in agent mode, with instructions added to the `gemini.md` file.
